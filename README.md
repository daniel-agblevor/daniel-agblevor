# 👋 Hi, I'm Daniel — Data Scientist | AI Engineer | Backend Developer

Welcome to my GitHub profile. I specialize in building data-driven systems, AI-powered applications, and scalable backend architectures that solve real-world problems.

## 🚀 What I Do

As a data scientist with a strong backend engineering focus, I design and deploy production-grade solutions at the intersection of machine learning, automation, and modern web infrastructure. My work is driven by a deep understanding of both the technical and business sides of AI products.

- 🔍 **Data Science & Predictive Modeling** – Building reliable models that deliver business value, especially in education, healthcare, and customer service.
- 🧠 **AI-Powered Assistants** – Architecting Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems using FAISS and LLMs like Gemini to create intelligent, compliant chatbots.
- ⚙️ **Backend Development** – Designing robust APIs using Flask and Django, with secure and scalable deployments.
- 📊 **Visualization & Insights** – Delivering compelling insights using SQL, Tableau, and Python-based analytics workflows.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack

**Languages & Frameworks**  
Python · SQL · JavaScript (Vanilla) · Flask · Django

**Data & AI Tooling**  
Pandas · scikit-learn · sentence-transformers · FAISS · OpenAI/Gemini APIs · RAG architectures

**Deployment & Ops**  
Netlify · Render · GitHub Actions · Jupyter Notebook · REST APIs · GDPR/HIPAA-compliant design principles

**Frontend Integration**  
Clean, functional UIs using HTML/CSS/JS – with AJAX enhancements and responsive design best practices

## 🧩 Types of Projects I Build

- 📈 **Student Enrollment Dashboards** – Portfolio-ready analytics tools built with SQL, Tableau, and Python
- 💬 **Healthcare AI Assistants** – Stateless, secure, and privacy-compliant LLM-backed chatbots
- 📱 **WhatsApp AI Integration** – Business automation through intelligent document-grounded agents
- 🔎 **Contact Info Extractors** – Lightweight Python tools for extracting structured data with regex

## 📌 Featured Repositories

Here are some projects that represent what I do best:

- [AI Health Assistant](https://github.com/daniel-agblevor/AI_Health_Assistant) – A secure, AI-powered health chatbot that uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to deliver intelligent, real-time responses grounded in internal clinical documentation. This project showcases applied Gen AI engineering, including vector search, document embedding, and integration with Gemini 1.5 via Google’s Generative AI SDK.

- [Student Enrollment Data Analysis](https://github.com/daniel-agblevor/Student_Enrollment_Data_Analysis) – This project focuses on analyzing and preparing student enrollment data from a relational database to generate insights and visualizations in Tableau. The SQL script provided includes queries for exploring the database, preparing data, and categorizing student performance.

- [NBA Player Retention Prediction](https://github.com/daniel-agblevor/NBA_Player_Retention_Prediction) – This project focuses on feature engineering and predictive modelling using NBA player data. The goal is to predict whether a player will remain in the league for 5 years (`target_5yrs`) based on various performance metrics.

- [FruitMart](https://github.com/daniel-agblevor/FruitMart) – A responsive, modular e-commerce web application designed for grocery and fresh produce browsing. Built with Django and Bootstrap, it features a scalable architecture suitable for small-to-mid-scale digital storefronts.

- [Hosting a Static Website](https://github.com/daniel-agblevor/Hosting-a-Static-Website) – Demonstrates how to host a static website using GitHub Pages, providing a simple and free solution for showcasing projects or personal portfolios.
