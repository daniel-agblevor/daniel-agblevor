# 👋 Hi, I'm Daniel Yao Agblevor

Welcome to my GitHub. I'm a cross-functional AI, Software, and Data Engineer with a passion for building **production-ready, intelligent systems**. My focus is on architecting and deploying **AI-powered solutions**—with a particular emphasis on healthcare—using modern machine learning, cloud infrastructure, and rigorous data science.

## 🩺 Featured Project: AI Healthcare Assistant

I've recently developed a **HIPAA-aware AI Healthcare Chatbot**, designed to deliver real-time, compliant medical responses by grounding queries in trusted source documents via **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**.

🔹 **Architecture**:

* **Frontend**: Stateless UI deployed on Netlify
* **Backend**: Flask API with Gemini 1.5 integration
* **Search**: Vector database powered by FAISS + Sentence-Transformers
* **Security**: GDPR/HIPAA-conscious design with sessionless architecture

🔹 **Key Capabilities**:

* Real-time medical query handling
* Document-based grounding before fallback to general LLM
* Scalable, API-first design for multi-platform integration (e.g., WhatsApp Business)

🔹 **Outcome**:
A scalable, domain-specific AI assistant that reduces response time, enhances patient support, and ensures trustworthiness in AI-driven healthcare communication.
